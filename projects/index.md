## Geographic Health Indicators

Visualization project looking at different health indicators, derived from data pulled from the [Health Indicators Warehouse](http://healthindicators.gov/) and [geographic variation](http://www.iom.edu/Activities/HealthServices/GeographicVariation/Data-Resources.aspx) data from the Institute of Medicine. The visualizations show the geographic distribution of different health indicators - [obesity](cms-geo/obesity.html), [diabetes](cms-geo/diabetes.html), and [diabetes among medicare participants](cms-geo/diabetes-medicare.html). Choose one of the maps above to select. Except for the medicare data, you can choose a year. You can change the color legend by clicking on it.


## Cinevis

<a href="http://jgoodall.github.com/cinevis/">![Explore Film Budgets, Revenues and Ratings](./img/cinevis.png)</a>

[Cinevis](http://jgoodall.github.com/cinevis/) was an experiment with [d3js](http://d3js.org/) for the information is beautiful [challenge of the stars](http://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/2012/01/challenge-of-the-stars/). One of the [awards](http://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/2012/03/hall-of-fame-hollywood-challenge-winners/) implemented a [very similar idea](http://indexity.net/vis/hw/), but was a bit slicker looking. I ran out of time...


## TNV

<a href="http://tnv.sourceforge.net/">![tnv depicts network traffic by visualizing packets and links between local and remote hosts](./img/tnv.png)</a>

[tnv](http://tnv.sourceforge.net/) is intended for network traffic analysis to facilitate learning what constitutes 'normal' activity on a network, investigating packet details security events, or network troubleshooting. tnv can open saved libpcap (from tcpdump, windump, ethereal, etc.) formatted files or capture live packets on the wire, and export data in libpcap format or save the data to a MySQL database to enable examining trends over time. This was part of my disertation, and, as such, is pretty old.
